### HW12

I think it mostly works. Sometimes a score is counted multiple times but not always. Hitting objects, the wall, or
computer opponent resets the player and score. The computer can move through objects but is also reset if it hits
the wall. I feel my script was getting pretty messy at the end and would consider splitting it up into multiple files 
next time.
