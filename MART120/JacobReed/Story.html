        <h1>Short Story</h1>
        <p>He stood there, looking down. His tired eyes with bags which carried in them many sleepless nights quivered downwards on all the people passing by. No one bothered to look up, why would they? People like them only look down on people like him, it doesn’t matter what he does next… no one will look.

A man, once you strip back his abnormalities that is all who he is by nature... A man. Once you strip away those tired eyes who have forgotten how to see clearly, that untouched mouth which has forgotten how to smile, those abandoned ears who beg to hear sweet whispers once again.

He misses her.

He misses the way she brought colour into his world, they were two jigsaw puzzle pieces put together to see the bigger picture. Many nights spent so tenderly in each other’s arms. She started a fire inside of him which raged, it furiously burned with love! She looked up to him. No experience in his life could match up to the feeling of being around her. His soul is forever bonded with hers, any other life is not worth living… He could be in a rocket heading to the moon, he could be a billionaire attending the most delightful events, he could be an artist loved by millions, but none of it could be compared to the feeling of her. She stewed the fire inside of him which lit up his entire life, but the rainclouds soon came, and she was blown away… she couldn’t find her way back to stow the fire within him once again.

He never knew where she went, he didn’t move from that place in months, until this afternoon, just in case she’d come back, she’d knew where to look.

The sun began to set; it was time to move on.

Both feet stood firmly on the edge of the building. His legs stood in position as if they were two soldiers standing side by side getting ready for their last battle. His hands relaxed from a bitter fist and he could feel the wind passing through all of his fingers. He took a deep breath and let the fresh air fill up both his lungs and into every crevice. His broken heart which still managed to beat began its final symphony, a beat so soft it could send a baby to sleep. He exhaled his last breath as a free man; it was peaceful. With his body in a state of equanimity, he was ready… he closed his eyes on the world he learned to love… then hate.

He slowly leant over.

It didn’t take long for gravity to take the ropes and guide his body through the air. He could feel the rush of the breeze wash over his face and cleanse him of all the tears he had ever spilt. It was a beautiful feeling, for the first time in months… nothing mattered anymore.

His mouth remembered how to smile.

He couldn’t help himself, the feeling of freedom and redemption persuaded him to take one last peek of the world he was leaving behind. He pried his eyes open and he saw it…

the view from halfway down.

The sunset, so beautiful, as the light reflected off her skin.

She looked up at him; she was walking to that spot.

Regret capsulated his entire body as he yearned for safety back at the top, but more so he regretted opening his eyes…

To the view from halfway down..</p>
